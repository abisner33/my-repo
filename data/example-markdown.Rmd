This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
height = 10
width = 5
area = height * width
height
width
area
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.  This is what it looks like without 'echo = FALSE'


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

#Organization for labs:
1) create a "biometry" folder on your hard-drive (or usb stick, if not working on your computer).  
2) Within that folder, create a 'lab1' subfolder.  
3) Now copy this file to that new folder. 
4) for each new lab, make a new subfolder in 'biometry' and store the lab-specific stuff there.
5) for each new lab, create a markdown file to hold the lab contents.

Alter markdown file:

R markdown syntax cheatsheet is located at: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/rm-cheatsheet.html

1) change this file.  Alter the formatting (see cheat sheet) and alter the content of the non-R text.
2) change the R code in the code chunks.  An easy thing to do would be to change the settings for 'width' or 'height' above and see the effect on area.
3) make sure that you can knit the entire documentq
